    question = "Explain the concept of Object-Oriented Programming"
    answer = "Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects that contain data and code. It's based on four main principles: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. For example, in Python, we create classes that serve as blueprints for objects. This approach makes code more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain."

    question = "What is Machine Learning and how does it work?"
    answer = "Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It works by training algorithms on large datasets to identify patterns and make predictions. For instance, in supervised learning, we provide labeled training data to teach the model to recognize relationships between inputs and outputs. Common algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks."

    question = "How do you prioritize features in a product roadmap?"
    answer = "Feature prioritization involves evaluating features based on business value, user impact, and technical feasibility. I use frameworks like RICE (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) or MoSCoW (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won't-have) to score features. For example, a feature that affects 80% of users and has high business impact would get priority over a nice-to-have feature with low user reach. I also consider market timing, competitive landscape, and resource constraints."
